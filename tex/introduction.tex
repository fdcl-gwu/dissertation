\chapter{Introduction}
% Motivation for missions/studying asteroids
Small solar system bodies, such as asteroids and comets, continue to remain a focus of scientific study.
The small size of these bodies prevents the formation of large internal pressures and temperatures which helps to preserve the early chemistry of the solar system.
This insight offers additional detail into the formation of the Earth and also of the probable formation of other extrasolar planetary bodies.
Of particular interest are those near-Earth asteroids (NEA) which inhabit heliocentric orbits in the vicinity of the Earth. 
These easily accessible bodies provide attractive targets to support space industrialization, mining operations, and scientific missions.

% impact threat from asteroids
Furthermore, these asteroids are of keen interest for more practical purposes.
The recent meteor explosions in 2002 over Tagish Lake, Canada or over Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013 are clear evidence of the risk of asteroid impacts on the Earth.
These asteroids, which released an energy equivalent to \SI{5}{\kilo\tonne} of TNT, are estimated to strike the Earth on average every year~\cite{brown2002}.
Larger bodies, such as the \SI{60}{\meter} object that exploded over Tunguska, Russia in 1908, release the energy equivalent to \SI{10}{\mega\tonne} of TNT and will occur on average every \num{1000} years.
Asteroids and comets are the greatest threat to future civilizations and as a result there is a focused effort to mitigate these risks~\cite{wie2008}.
A wide variety of strategies, including nuclear standoff detonation, mass drivers, kinetic-energy projectiles, and low-thrust deflection via electric propulsion or solar sails, have been proposed to deal with the technically challenging asteroid mitigation problem~\cite{adams2004}.
In spite of the significant interest in asteroid deflection, and the extensive research by the community, the operation of spacecraft in their vicinity remains a challenging problem.

% Overall thesis. Development of autonomous methods to operate around small bodies.
This dissertation studies the operation of spacecraft around small-bodies with an explicit focus on the accurate representation of the geometric properties of the dynamic enviornment.
An optimal control formulation is developed to enable the use of low thrust propulsion systems to generate large magnitude orbital transfers.
Next, the dynamics of a spacecraft are derived with a special focus on the preservation of the geometric properties of the motion.
Finally, an efficient computational geometry based approach is developed to reconstruct the small-body shape.
The goal of this work is to develop tools for the autonomous operations of spacecraft around small-bodies.

\section{Motivation}


% Add some missions that have gone/will go to asteroids
The sustained interest in small solar system bodies has resulted in a number of planetary science missions.
These missions vary in scope from flybys or rendezvous missions to impactors and sample return missions. 
The first successful rendezvous and landing with a small body was accomplished by \gls{nasa} NEAR-Shoemaker spacecraft at asteroid Eros in \num{2000}~\cite{miller2002}.
The first sample return was achieved in \num{2005} by \gls{jaxa} Hayabusa spacecraft at asteroid \num{25143} Itokawa~\cite{yoshimitsu2009}.
In \num{2011}, \gls{nasa} Dawn spacecraft rendezvoused with asteroid  Vesta and then later with Ceres and became the first spacecraf to orbit two distinct bodies within a single mission~\cite{rayman2006}.
More recently, in \num{2014} the first comet rendezvous and landing was achieved by \gls{esa} Rosetta spacecraft and lander Philae at comet \(67/P\) Churyumov-Gerasimenko~\cite{bibring2015}.
Currently, the \gls{nasa} OSIRIS-REx mission is enroute to asteroid Bennu with the goal to rendezvous, collect a surface sample, and return to the Earth~\cite{beshore2015}.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Low thrust reachability}
% Motivation for missions/studying asteroids
Small solar system bodies, such as asteroids and comets, continue to remain a focus of scientific study.
The small size of these bodies prevents the formation of large internal pressures and temperatures which helps to preserve the early chemistry of the solar system.
This insight offers additional detail into the formation of the Earth and also of the probable formation of other extrasolar planetary bodies.
Of particular interest are those near-Earth asteroids (NEA) which inhabit heliocentric orbits in the vicinity of the Earth. 
These easily accessible bodies provide attractive targets to support space industrialization, mining operations, and scientific missions.
In spite of the significant interest, and the extensive research by the community, the operation of spacecraft near small bodies remains a challenging problem.

% dynamics are difficult around asteroids
The dynamic environment around asteroids is strongly perturbed and challenging for analysis and mission operations~\cite{scheeres2012}.
Due to their low mass, which in turn causes a low gravitational attraction, asteroids may have irregular shapes.
Furthermore, asteroids may also have a chaotic spin state due to the absorption and emittance of solar radiation~\cite{rubincam2000}.
As a result, approaches utilizing an inverse square gravitational model do not capture the  true dynamic environment.
In addition, the vast majority of asteroids are difficult to track and characterize using ground based sensors.
Due to their small size, frequently with a maximum radius less than \SI{1}{\kilo\meter}, and low albedo, the reflected energy of these asteroids is insufficient for reliable detection or tracking.
Therefore, the dynamics model of the asteroid is relatively coarse prior to in situ measurements from a dedicated spacecraft.
As a result, any spacecraft mission to an asteroid must include the ability to update the dynamic model given in situ measurements and remain robust to unmodelled forces.

Another key dynamic consideration is the coupling between rotational and translational states around the asteroid.
The coupling is induced due to the different gravitational forces experienced on various portions of the spacecraft. 
The effect of the gravitational coupling is related to the ratio of the spacecraft size and orbital radius~\cite{hughes2004}.
For operations around asteroids, the ratio is relatively large which causes a much larger coupling between the translational and rotational states.
References~\textcite{elmasri2005} and~\textcite{sanyal2004a} investigated the coupling of an elastic dumbbell spacecraft in orbit about a central body, but only considered the case of a spherically symmetric central body.
Furthermore, the spacecraft model is assumed to remain in a planar orbit.
As a result, these developments are not directly applicable to motion about an asteroid, which experiences highly non-Keplerian motion.
Reference~\textcite{misra2015b} investigated the effect of coupled motion on long term trajectories around asteroids.
However, the analysis only considered a second order spherical harmonic gravitational potential model. 
Therefore, these results are only valid when far from the asteroid surface and will diverge when used within the Brillouin sphere.

% Gravity model is important and dependent on shape
An accurate gravitational potential model is critical for performing low altitude and/or surface operations around asteroids.
Due to the irregular shape, trajectories will pass within the Brillouin sphere, where the typical spherical harmonic model diverges from the true gravitational potential.
The standard approach for asteroid missions is to compute the gravitational potential using a polyhedron potential model~\cite{werner1996}.
The polyhedron potential model provides the exact gravitational potential, and subsequently the gravitational acceleration, for a given triangular faceted shape model of an asteroid.
The method provides the exact potential at any point outside the body for a given shape model.
As a result, the accuracy of the gravitational potential is primarily dependent on the accuracy with which the shape model represents the true surface.
A high fidelity shape, which necessarily has many vertices and faces, is required for an accurate computation of the gravitational acceleration and enabling low altitude operations.

% Challenges involved in operation near asteroids (gravity, shape, distance)
% generating the shape from the ground is difficult
Prior to the arrival of a spacecraft at an asteroid, Earth-based sensors are used to characterize the body.
Using both optical and radar sensors allows for the precise orbit of the asteroid to be determined.
Another vital task is the determination of the asteroid shape from radar data~\cite{hudson1994,busch2011}.
This is a challenging problem as it requires the simultaneous estimation of the asteroid spin state and shape.
Furthermore, determining the shape from radar is currently the only Earth-based technique that can produce detailed three-dimensional shape information of near-Earth objects~\cite{greenberg2015}.
The current approach is based on an estimation scheme which iteratively perturbs a shape to match given radar data.
This computationally intensive approach is only able to capture the gross size and shape and is unable to capture the small surface features of the asteroid.
Frequently, only a coarse model is possible from the ground and an accurate shape must be determined only after a spacecraft has rendezvoused with the asteroid.
As a result, upon arrival the gravitational environment near the asteroid is poorly modeled as the shape of the asteroid is not accurate.
Therefore, the polyhedron potential model is not appropriate immediately upon arrival but rather only after the shape has been determined.

% on arrival spacecraft spend long periods mapping, and depending on mission this might be unallocable
On approach to an asteroid, spacecraft navigation and guidance is primarily based on ground measurements.
After arrival, a spacecraft will generally spend months or years in a mapping mission phase~\cite{kubota2003,cole1998}.
During this period, spacecraft sensors, such as on board optical telescopes or Light radio Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), are used to characterize the asteroid.
The resulting imagery and range data is transmitted to the ground and the resulting asteroid shape and motion is estimated. 
During this mapping phase the spacecraft must remain in a quiescent state devoted entirely to mapping the surface.
Depending on the mission type, this long period of mapping is crucial to the mission, such as sample collection~\cite{gates2015}. 
However, other missions, such as asteroid mitigation, may be severely limited by the time and ground resources required to generate a surface shape.
Furthermore, the long distances involved necessitate on-board autonomy to enable to spacecraft to operate without ground communications.
Similarly, during landing the spacecraft will require the ability to sense and model the surface topography in order to safely land in an unknown environment.
The dependency on expensive ground-based shape reconstruction techniques limits the ability of spacecraft to autonomously operate at asteroids.
Mitigation of this ground based surface modeling will greatly expand the range of missions possible.

% we want to generate the shape in real time and then use this shape for updated and better control
In this paper, we develop a method to compute the surface shape of an asteroid from range measurements.
Our approach is able to operate in real time and incrementally update the shape model of an asteroid as new range measurements are collected.
This approach allows for the shape to be continually updated as range measurements are used to locally modify the shape estimate.
Furthermore, this updated shape is then used in a nonlinear controller to enable the tracking of a landing trajectory to the surface.
In contrast to previous work, we explicitly consider the gravitational coupling between orbit and attitude dynamics.
Furthermore, instead of computationally expensive surface reconstruction methods, we present a straightforward and conceptually simple method to enable real time shape updates. 


% our approach for paper. Real time method to update asteroid shape model and use updated model in closed loop control

% Benefits and contribution of our approach
In short, this paper presents a method to incrementally update the shape  model of an asteroid from range measurements. 
Our approach alleviates the need for a dedicated mapping phase as the spacecraft is able to update its shape model in real time and without expensive computations.
This type of approach allows for the spacecraft to maneuver and land on the asteroid immediately upon arrival rather than spending several months mapping the surface.
This updated shape model is then used to in a nonlinear controller to track a desired state trajectory for the dynamics of a rigid body spacecraft.
The dynamics are developed on the nonlinear manifold of rigid body motions, namely the special euclidean group.
This formulation is based on an intrinsic geometric description of the motion and accurately captures the coupling between orbit and attitude dynamics. 
The presented approach allows for a spacecraft to transition directly from arrival to the surface while reconstructing the surface shape in real time.



\subsection{Nonlinear Control}

\subsection{Surface Reconstruction}
One of the main mission objectives for asteroid operations is to generate the three-dimensional shape of an asteroid.
This shape generation is a subset of a larger class of methods called surface reconstruction.
The goal of surface reconstruction is stated as follows: Given a set of sample points \( X\) assumed to lie on /near the surface \( U \), create a surface model \( S \) approximating \( U \).
Surface reconstruction is a well-researched field and widely applied in the industrial and computer vision fields.
The generation of a surface from an object is important in reverse engineering, product design and medical product construction~\cite{amenta2001}.
The surface reconstruction problem is applied in a variety of fields in science and engineering including 3D scanning, surface reconstruction from contours and surface sketching~\cite{hoppe1992}.

Surface reconstruction, or sometimes referred to as 3D scanning, is the generation of accurate models of real world objects.
Surface Reconstruction techniques are frequently used to digitize sculptures/architecture, machine parts, archaeological artifacts, or terrain.
There are a variety of methods to digitize objects, such as laser range finding, mechanical touch probes, or computer vision techniques, i.e. depth from stereo.
From these digitization methods, a large collection, often times on the order of \( 10^6 - 10^9\), of points are generated.
From this \gls{point_cloud}, the goal is to construct a surface representation which is faithful to the original data, and the underlying object of interest.
This process of generating the surface should ideally have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fast - low computational cost
    \item Low memory - storing/operating on large collection of points is frequently memory constrained. Also for use in constrained enviornments
    \item Robustness - Algorithm must be robust to holes, noisy data, varying or low sample density
    \item Accuracy - the method should approximate the shape based on the data rather than interpolating between data points
    \item Features - ability to capture sharp edges or features
\end{itemize}

% TODO Describe different methods of surface reconstruction

The \gls{implicit_shape} representation allows for a complex shape to be defined by a single equation.
This approach has the additional benefit of unifying both the surface and volume rendering to a single equation.
The main advantage associated with implicit surface approach is handling sparse or scattered data.
It is possible to repair or edit the shape using standard implicit modeling operations.
For example, given two implicit surfaces
\begin{align*}
    F_1(x, y, z) &= 0, \\
    F_2(x, y, z) &= 0 ,
\end{align*}
one can define a new surface as
\begin{align*}
    F(x, y, z) = \mu F_1(x, y, z) + (1-\mu) F_2(x,y,z) = 0,
\end{align*}
where \( \mu \in \bracket{0, 1}\) is a design parameters defining the blending between the two input surfaces.
This blending allows one to use primitive shapes/models to create complex surfaces.
% TODO Find citation for this (blending of implicit shapes)
However, this implicit representation makes it difficult to modify the local shape of the surface. 
Examples of this approach include~\cite{bolitho2009,hoppe1992,ohtake2005}.
% TODO Describe in more detail the difference, drawbacks/advantages, of each implicit surface approach.

Surface reconstruction was first addressed in the early 80's~\cite{uselton1983,uselton1981}.
The main goal of this early work was focused on developing methods to accurately and efficiently display three dimensional data on a computing system.
The resulting work developed a computational algorithm to construct the three-dimensional polygonal representation of an object from the collection of points describing the surface.
The determination of a polygonal surface through a series of points is a relatively straightforward problem, as there an infinite number of solutions.
However, determining the ``best'' surface is a more challenging problem.
As the original surface is typically not available, hence the need for measurement and digitization, the quality of the resulting surface must be computed using the measurement points.

Another approach is to use the sculpting of delauney triangulation~\cite{boissonnat1984}.
Further refinements came with the notion of \( \alpha \) shapes~\cite{edelsbrunner1994}.
The notion of a signed distance function and the implicit shape representation proposed~\cite{hoppe1992}.
A modification of this approach extended it to a voxel grid~\cite{curless1996}.
Ball pivoting allows for a relatively simple method of determining the surface~\cite{bernardini1999}.
Next, another method seeks to project sample points, with neighbors onto a plane then lift the local two dimensional delauney triangulation to reconstruct the surface~\cite{gopi2000}.

Our overarching goal for the surface reconstruction is to develop an efficient algorithm which allows for online, or near realtime, surface reconstruction from a sparse point cloud.
Furthermore, this method should allow for an incremental update given a new partial point cloud.
For example, given an initial coarse point cloud representing the initial guess of the surface, new, high density data, is acquired in a specific location on the surface.
Instead of processing the entire point cloud, and recomputing the global mesh, an incremental update would allow for modification of only the local neighborhood of the additional data.
Another useful requirment would be the ability to easily combine two overlapping point clouds into a single surface mesh.
Finally, the resulting surface should be topologically valid and without holes, i.e. a polyhedron mesh with triangular facets.

\subsubsection{Watertight surface mesh}

There are two main approaches to generate water tight surface meshes.
The powercrust algorithm seeks to approximate the \gls{MAT} of a three-dimensional object~\cite{amenta2001}.
Then the inverse map is used to produce a watertight boundary.

Another approach is the tight cocone algorithm~\cite{dey2006}.
This reduced the complexity of powercrust and uses a post processing method to fill any holes.

\subsubsection{3D Scanning}
There are several different approches to acquire shape information of an object.
The computer vision field several approaches exist to determine the shape of an object.
In feature correspondance, landmarks are registered and compared across several different  views of an object. 
The shape of the surface is inferred given the known motion of the camera system~\cite{szeliski2010}.
Another approach is based on the different surface reflectivity of the surface, called shape from shading~\cite{szeliski2010}.

\subsection{Attitude Parameterizations}\label{ssec:attitude_parameterization}
% TODO Think about moving this section to the introduction
% Discuss the benefits of using this geometric representation as compared to Euler angles or quaternions
Attitude parameterizations, such as Euler angles and Quaternions, are frequently used in the aerospace and astrodynamics communities~\cite{vallado2007}.
For example, Euler angle sequences are frequently used to describe the transformation between a variety of reference frames used to describe the position and orientation of the orbit of Earth satellites~\cite{vallado2007}.
In addition, quaternions were used during the operation of Skylab and the NASA Space Shuttle~\cite{hughes2004}.
However, the choice of attitude parameterization plays a critical role in control design and the resulting motion of the system.

% singularities and the problems involved with using Euler angles
Euler angle sequences are a minimum, three-parameter set of angles which describe the transformation between two reference frames.
Using Euler angles, we can represent any general rotation as a sequence of three intermediate rotations~\cite{shuster1993}.
By convention, there are \num{24} possible Euler angle sequences for any given rotation.
In addition, Euler angles are a minimum representation, as only three angles, and the associated sequence, are required to describe the three angular degrees of freedom of the rigid body.
However, there is great ambiguity in the representation of the attitude as there are many equivalent Euler angle sequences for a given attitude of the system.
Therefore, great care must be taken in the control system design to ensure that a consistent sequence is used. 
Furthermore, it has been shown that no minimal attitude representation can describe orientations both globally and without singularities~\cite{hughes2004,bhat2000}.
These singularities can cause significant difficulties during control design and hardware implementation.

To demonstrate the effect of the kinematic singularities inherent with Euler angles we will represent the attitude of the body fixed reference frame, \( \vc{b}_i \), with respect to the inertial frame, \( \vc{e}_i\), in terms of the 3-1-3 Euler angle sequence.
More explicitly, this corresponds to the rotation sequence \( \theta_1 \vc{b}_3 , \theta_2 \vc{b}_1, \theta_3 \vc{b}_3 \).
The rotation matrix, \( R(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3) \), corresponding to this sequence is 
\begin{align}\label{eq:euler313}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -s_1 c_2 s_3 + c_3 c_1 & -s_1 c_2 c_3 - s_3 c_1 & s_1s_2 \\
        c_1 c_2 s_3 + c_3 s_1 & c_1 c_2 c_3 - s_3 s_1 & - c_1 s_2 \\
        s_2 s_3 & s_2 c_3 & c_2
    \end{bmatrix} ,
\end{align}
where \( s_i, c_i \) represent \( \sin \theta_i, \cos \theta_i \) for \( i = \braces{1,2,3}\).
Using this representation, the kinematic differential equations for the associated Euler angles are given as
\begin{align}\label{eq:euler313_diff}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \dot{\theta}_1 \\ \dot{\theta}_2 \\ \dot{\theta}_3 
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \slfrac{\parenth{\Omega_1 s_3 + \Omega_2 c_3}}{s_2} \\
        \Omega_1 c_3 - \Omega_2 s_3 \\
        -\slfrac{\parenth{\Omega_1 s_3 + \omega_2 c_3}c_2}{s_2} + \Omega_3
    \end{bmatrix} .
\end{align}
From~\cref{eq:euler313_diff}, it is immediately clear that a singularity exists when \( \sin \theta_2 = 0 \) or equivalently, \( \theta_2 = 0, \pm \pi \). 
In the vicinity of the singularity, the angular velocities of the Euler angles will tend to approach \( \pm \infty \) and the angular velocities will experience instantaneous sign changes.
Furthermore, all Euler angle sequences will exhibit a similar singularity at either \( \theta_2 = 0, \pm \pi \) or \( \theta_2 = \pm \frac{\pi}{2}, \pm \frac{3\pi}{2} \).
Therefore simply switching the sequence does not alleviate the issue, but rather only moves the singularity.
As a result, Euler angles are not appropriate for systems which experience large angular rotations, such as those demonstrated in~\cref{fig:adapt}, or control systems which rely on the angular velocities \( \theta_i \).
