\section{Computational Geometry}

This section can discuss some background in computational geometry.

The majority of computational geometry algorithms are developed for simple planar \glspl{polygon}.

The surface of an object is described as the union of the surfaces of the polygons which define it.


\subsection{Surface Reconstruction}
One of the main mission objectives for asteroid operations is to generate the three-dimensional shape of an asteroid.
This shape generation is a subset of a larger class of methods called surface reconstruction.
The goal of surface reconstruction is stated as follows: Given a set of sample points \( X\) assumed to lie on /near the surface \( U \), create a surface model \( S \) approximating \( U \).
Surface reconstruction is a well-researched field and widely applied in the industrial and computer vision fields.
The generation of a surface from an object is important in reverse engineering, product design and medical product construction~\cite{amenta2001}.
The surface reconstruction problem is applied in a variety of fields in science and engineering including 3D scanning, surface reconstruction from contours and surface sketching~\cite{hoppe1992}.

Surface reconstruction, or sometimes referred to as 3D scanning, is the generation of accurate models of real world objects.
Surface Reconstruction techniques are frequently used to digitize sculptures/architecture, machine parts, archaeological artifacts, or terrain.
There are a variety of methods to digitize objects, such as laser range finding, mechanical touch probes, or computer vision techniques, i.e. depth from stereo.
From these digitization methods, a large collection, often times on the order of \( 10^6 - 10^9\), of points are generated.
From this \gls{point_cloud}, the goal is to construct a surface representation which is faithful to the original data, and the underlying object of interest.
This process of generating the surface should ideally have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fast - low computational cost
    \item Low memory - storing/operating on large collection of points is frequently memory constrained. Also for use in constrained enviornments
    \item Robustness - Algorithm must be robust to holes, noisy data, varying or low sample density
    \item Accuracy - the method should approximate the shape based on the data rather than interpolating between data points
    \item Features - ability to capture sharp edges or features
\end{itemize}

% TODO Describe different methods of surface reconstruction

The \gls{implicit_shape} representation allows for a complex shape to be defined by a single equation.
This approach has the additional benefit of unifying both the surface and volume rendering to a single equation.
The main advantage associated with implicit surface approach is handling sparse or scattered data.
It is possible to repair or edit the shape using standard implicit modeling operations.
For example, given two implicit surfaces
\begin{align*}
    F_1(x, y, z) &= 0, \\
    F_2(x, y, z) &= 0 ,
\end{align*}
one can define a new surface as
\begin{align*}
    F(x, y, z) = \mu F_1(x, y, z) + (1-\mu) F_2(x,y,z) = 0,
\end{align*}
where \( \mu \in \bracket{0, 1}\) is a design parameters defining the blending between the two input surfaces.
This blending allows one to use primitive shapes/models to create complex surfaces.
% TODO Find citation for this (blending of implicit shapes)
However, this implicit representation makes it difficult to modify the local shape of the surface. 
Examples of this approach include~\cite{bolitho2009,hoppe1992,ohtake2005}.
% TODO Describe in more detail the difference, drawbacks/advantages, of each implicit surface approach.

Surface reconstruction was first addressed in the early 80's~\cite{uselton1983,uselton1981}.
The main goal of this early work was focused on developing methods to accurately and efficiently display three dimensional data on a computing system.
The resulting work developed a computational algorithm to construct the three-dimensional polygonal representation of an object from the collection of points describing the surface.
The determination of a polygonal surface through a series of points is a relatively straightforward problem, as there an infinite number of solutions.
However, determining the ``best'' surface is a more challenging problem.
As the original surface is typically not available, hence the need for measurement and digitization, the quality of the resulting surface must be computed using the measurement points.

Another approach is to use the sculpting of delauney triangulation~\cite{boissonnat1984}.
Further refinements came with the notion of \( \alpha \) shapes~\cite{edelsbrunner1994}.
The notion of a signed distance function and the implicit shape representation proposed~\cite{hoppe1992}.
A modification of this approach extended it to a voxel grid~\cite{curless1996}.
Ball pivoting allows for a relatively simple method of determining the surface~\cite{bernardini1999}.
Next, another method seeks to project sample points, with neighbors onto a plane then lift the local two dimensional delauney triangulation to reconstruct the surface~\cite{gopi2000}.

Our overarching goal for the surface reconstruction is to develop an efficient algorithm which allows for online, or near realtime, surface reconstruction from a sparse point cloud.
Furthermore, this method should allow for an incremental update given a new partial point cloud.
For example, given an initial coarse point cloud representing the initial guess of the surface, new, high density data, is acquired in a specific location on the surface.
Instead of processing the entire point cloud, and recomputing the global mesh, an incremental update would allow for modification of only the local neighborhood of the additional data.
Another useful requirment would be the ability to easily combine two overlapping point clouds into a single surface mesh.
Finally, the resulting surface should be topologically valid and without holes, i.e. a polyhedron mesh with triangular facets.

\subsubsection{Watertight surface mesh}

There are two main approaches to generate water tight surface meshes.
The powercrust algorithm seeks to approximate the \gls{MAT} of a three-dimensional object~\cite{amenta2001}.
Then the inverse map is used to produce a watertight boundary.

Another approach is the tight cocone algorithm~\cite{dey2006}.
This reduced the complexity of powercrust and uses a post processing method to fill any holes.

\subsubsection{3D Scanning}
There are several different approches to acquire shape information of an object.
The computer vision field several approaches exist to determine the shape of an object.
In feature correspondance, landmarks are registered and compared across several different  views of an object. 
The shape of the surface is inferred given the known motion of the camera system~\cite{szeliski2010}.
Another approach is based on the different surface reflectivity of the surface, called shape from shading~\cite{szeliski2010}.

\subsection{Attitude Parameterizations}\label{ssec:attitude_parameterization}
% TODO Think about moving this section to the introduction
% Discuss the benefits of using this geometric representation as compared to Euler angles or quaternions
Attitude parameterizations, such as Euler angles and Quaternions, are frequently used in the aerospace and astrodynamics communities~\cite{vallado2007}.
For example, Euler angle sequences are frequently used to describe the transformation between a variety of reference frames used to describe the position and orientation of the orbit of Earth satellites~\cite{vallado2007}.
In addition, quaternions were used during the operation of Skylab and the NASA Space Shuttle~\cite{hughes2004}.
However, the choice of attitude parameterization plays a critical role in control design and the resulting motion of the system.

% singularities and the problems involved with using Euler angles
Euler angle sequences are a minimum, three-parameter set of angles which describe the transformation between two reference frames.
Using Euler angles, we can represent any general rotation as a sequence of three intermediate rotations~\cite{shuster1993}.
By convention, there are \num{24} possible Euler angle sequences for any given rotation.
In addition, Euler angles are a minimum representation, as only three angles, and the associated sequence, are required to describe the three angular degrees of freedom of the rigid body.
However, there is great ambiguity in the representation of the attitude as there are many equivalent Euler angle sequences for a given attitude of the system.
Therefore, great care must be taken in the control system design to ensure that a consistent sequence is used. 
Furthermore, it has been shown that no minimal attitude representation can describe orientations both globally and without singularities~\cite{hughes2004,bhat2000}.
These singularities can cause significant difficulties during control design and hardware implementation.

To demonstrate the effect of the kinematic singularities inherent with Euler angles we will represent the attitude of the body fixed reference frame, \( \vc{b}_i \), with respect to the inertial frame, \( \vc{e}_i\), in terms of the 3-1-3 Euler angle sequence.
More explicitly, this corresponds to the rotation sequence \( \theta_1 \vc{b}_3 , \theta_2 \vc{b}_1, \theta_3 \vc{b}_3 \).
The rotation matrix, \( R(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3) \), corresponding to this sequence is 
\begin{align}\label{eq:euler313}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -s_1 c_2 s_3 + c_3 c_1 & -s_1 c_2 c_3 - s_3 c_1 & s_1s_2 \\
        c_1 c_2 s_3 + c_3 s_1 & c_1 c_2 c_3 - s_3 s_1 & - c_1 s_2 \\
        s_2 s_3 & s_2 c_3 & c_2
    \end{bmatrix} ,
\end{align}
where \( s_i, c_i \) represent \( \sin \theta_i, \cos \theta_i \) for \( i = \braces{1,2,3}\).
Using this representation, the kinematic differential equations for the associated Euler angles are given as
\begin{align}\label{eq:euler313_diff}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \dot{\theta}_1 \\ \dot{\theta}_2 \\ \dot{\theta}_3 
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \slfrac{\parenth{\Omega_1 s_3 + \Omega_2 c_3}}{s_2} \\
        \Omega_1 c_3 - \Omega_2 s_3 \\
        -\slfrac{\parenth{\Omega_1 s_3 + \omega_2 c_3}c_2}{s_2} + \Omega_3
    \end{bmatrix} .
\end{align}
From~\cref{eq:euler313_diff}, it is immediately clear that a singularity exists when \( \sin \theta_2 = 0 \) or equivalently, \( \theta_2 = 0, \pm \pi \). 
In the vicinity of the singularity, the angular velocities of the Euler angles will tend to approach \( \pm \infty \) and the angular velocities will experience instantaneous sign changes.
Furthermore, all Euler angle sequences will exhibit a similar singularity at either \( \theta_2 = 0, \pm \pi \) or \( \theta_2 = \pm \frac{\pi}{2}, \pm \frac{3\pi}{2} \).
Therefore simply switching the sequence does not alleviate the issue, but rather only moves the singularity.
As a result, Euler angles are not appropriate for systems which experience large angular rotations, such as those demonstrated in~\cref{fig:adapt}, or control systems which rely on the angular velocities \( \theta_i \).
