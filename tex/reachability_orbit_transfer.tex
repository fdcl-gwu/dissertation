\chapter{Low Thrust Orbital Transfers using Reachability Sets}\label{sec:lowthrust_transfers}
In this chapter, we propose a systematic design method which enables low-thrust transfers in the planar circular restricted three-body problem as well as an extension for use about asteroids.
We utilize the concept of the reachability set to enable a simple methodology of selecting initial conditions to achieve general orbital transfers. 
The reachable set, defined as the set of all attainable states subject to the system constraints, allows for the extension of the previous control-free methods based on invariant manifolds.
Defining the reachable set on a \Poincare section reduces the dimensionality of the system dynamics to the study of a related discrete update map.
Through the use of low-thrust control input, the reachable set on the \Poincare section is enlarged and enables a larger space of potential transfers.
By iteratively computing the reachable set, and minimizing the distance to the target on the \Poincare section, we generate general transfer trajectories.
With this proposed method, the previous research on control-free trajectories will be generalized with the addition of low thrust propulsion systems.

The method is formulated as an extension to the control free method based on invariant manifolds in the three-body problem~\cite{koon2011}.
Much of the previous work using invariant manifolds has been applied to the planar circular restricted three body problem.
This paper provides a discrete optimal control formulation to generate the reachability set on a \Poincare section.
