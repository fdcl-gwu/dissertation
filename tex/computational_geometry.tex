\chapter{Computational Geometry}

Computational geometry is defined as the systematic study of algorithms and data structures for geometric objects.
A specific focus is on exact algorithms thar are asymptotically fast.
Computational geometry emerged from the fields of computer science in the late 1970s.
Since that time, the field has grown considerably and has found applications in a large variety of domains, suchs as computer graphics, \gls{gis}, robotics, \gls{CAD}, computer vision, and others.
