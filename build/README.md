This directory is for the build files that are generated by LaTeX.

Specifically, the tikz externalization will place all the prebuilt tikz 
figures into this directory. You can look at chapter 50 of the tikz 
documentation or just delete the PDF files in this directory to have
tikz regenerate the images.
